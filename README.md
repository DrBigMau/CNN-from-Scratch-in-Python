# CNN from Scratch

 Lecture material (codes, pdf). Learning how to create CNNs with numpy only

 Creating a CNN from scratch, only using numpy, step by step. Each chapter contains a fully functional code for the corresponding topic. PDFs of the lecture (from ppt) explaining the mathematical background are added too.   

## Chapters are:

 1 single neuron  
 2 layers of neurons  
 3 activation functions  
 4 softmax  
 5 loss and entropy  
 6 backprob  
 7 optimizer  
 8 learning and training  
 9 convolution     
 10 pooling  
 11 sigmoid and tanh  
 12 flattening  
 13 backprob II    
 14 testing and building LeNet   

 Lecture was inspired by the excellent book from Harrison Kinsley & Daniel Kukiela
